# Stolen Vehicles Analysis Project

## Overview

This project was undertaken to assist the police department in releasing a public service announcement aimed at raising awareness about vehicle thefts. The analysis focused on identifying when, where, and which types of vehicles are most susceptible to theft across various regions.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze Stolen Vehicles Data**
   - **Annual Vehicle Theft**: The number of vehicles stolen was calculated for each year.
   - **Monthly Vehicle Theft**: The monthly counts of stolen vehicles were determined.
   - **Daily Vehicle Theft**: The number of vehicles stolen was assessed for each day of the week, with numeric values replaced by full day names (e.g., Sunday, Monday).

2. **Visualizations**
   - A bar chart was created to depict the number of vehicles stolen on each day of the week.
   - A heat map was generated to visualize the relationship between vehicle types and colors.

3. **Vehicle Type Analysis**
   - The most and least often stolen vehicle types were identified.
   - For each vehicle type, the average age of stolen cars was calculated.
   - The percentage of stolen vehicles categorized as luxury versus standard was analyzed.

4. **Regional Analysis**
   - The number of vehicles stolen in each region was determined and combined with population and density statistics.
   - A comparative analysis was conducted to see if the types of vehicles stolen in the three most densely populated regions differ from those in the three least densely populated regions.

5. **Scatter Plot Visualization**
   - A scatter plot was created to illustrate the relationship between population and density, with point sizes reflecting the number of vehicles stolen in each region.

6. **Regional Mapping**
   - A map of the regions was produced, coloring them based on the number of stolen vehicles.

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis aim to provide valuable insights to the police department and the community to enhance awareness and prevention strategies regarding vehicle theft.
